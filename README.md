# USYD Timetable Colours

## 2021 Update
As USYD now uses Allocate+ for timetables, this script is no longer applicable.

## Example
![alt text](https://github.com/zaxutic/USYD-Timetable-Colours/raw/master/src/img/timetable.png "Colour coded timetable example")

## Requirements
Installation of this requires a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Tampermonkey is available for all major browsers including [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en).

## Installation
After installing Tampermonkey (see above) or another userscript manager, get the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaxutic/USYD-Timetable-Colours/master/index.user.js).

Most userscript managers should recognise the file as a userscript and open the installation page for you, otherwise you will have to manually add it into your manager
